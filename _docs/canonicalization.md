## Guidance

All government websites must have `www` and non-`www` resolution.

## About

Domain canonicalization allows access to the intended website address, whether users type `www` (`www.example.gov`) or not (`example.gov`). Improper canonicalization will fail to direct `example.gov` to the intended address, and users will receive an error.

## Examples

Example of a government website with `www` and non-`www` resolution:

* <https://digital.gov>
* <https://www.digital.gov>
