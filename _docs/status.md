## Status types

* Active: Source was found.
* Missing: Source was not found.
* Redirect: URL redirects to another domain.
* Can't access: Site scraping is inaccessible (status 400/401/403/404/408/500,503). Domain manager has blocked bots in the metadata or server side or the domain doesn't exist. These domains don't have scores/grades and aren't factored into the averages.
