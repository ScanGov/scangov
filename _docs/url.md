## Guidance

All government websites must have Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), www and non-www resolution and a sponsored top-level domain (sTLD).

## About

Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the technical term for a website address (ex: `https://example.gov`).

Properly configured government URLs include:

* `https` protocol
* `www` and non-`www` canonicalization
* `.gov` / `.edu` / `.mil` extension

## HTTPS

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the strongest privacy and integrity protection currently available for public web connections. This is indicated by a lock icon and/or `https://` in the browser bar. HTTPS ensures users that their privacy is protected when visiting a government website.

## www / non-www

Domain canonicalization allows access to the intended website address, whether users type `www` (`www.example.gov`) or not (`example.gov`). Improper canonicalization will fail to direct `example.gov` to the intended address, and users will receive an error.

## .gov / .edu / .mil

Generic top-level domains (gTLD) (`.com`, `.org`, etc.) are non-country extensions that indicate the purpose or source of the website. Sponsored top-level domains (sTLD) (`.gov` / `.edu` / `.mil`) are a subgroup of gTLDs managed by designated organizations and restricted to specific registrant types.

A `.gov` / `.edu` / `.mil` extension verifies that the website is managed by a United States government organization (federal, state, local). Government non-.gov gTLDs can potentially confuse users and create opportunities for non-government entities to spoof official government services. Adopting the `.gov` / `.edu` / `.mil` extension ensures users are visiting an official government website.
